## Problem Description

### Binary Search

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.  
You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.  


## Examples

>**Input**: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
>**Output**: 4
>**Explanation**: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

>**Input**: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
>**Output**: -1
>**Explanation**: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1


## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4^`
- `-10^4^ < nums[i], target < 10^4^`
- All the integers in `nums` are ***unique***.
- `nums` is sorted in ***ascending order***.


## Ideas:

The premise of this topic is that the array is an *ordered* array, and the topic also emphasizes that there are *no repeating elements* in the array, because once there are repeating elements, the element subscript returned by the binary search method may not be unique, these are the prerequisites for the use of Binary Search, when you see the description of the topic meets the above conditions, you can think about whether you can use the Binary Search.  

Binary search involves a lot of boundary conditions, the logic is relatively simple, but it is not well written. For example, is it `while(left < right)` or `while(left <= right)`, is it `right = middle`, or is it `right = middle - 1`?  

People often write binary search, mainly because the definition of the interval is not clear, the definition of the interval is the invariant. To maintain invariants in the process of binary search, that is, in the while search, each boundary processing must adhere to the definition of the interval to operate, which is the loop invariant rule.  

Write binary search, the interval is generally defined in two ways, left closed right closed `[left, right]`, or left closed right open `[left, right)`.  
`[left, right]`: 
- `while (left <= right)` uses `<=` because `left == right` makes sense, so use `<=`.
- `if (nums[middle] > target) right` is set to `middle - 1`, because `nums[middle]` must not be a target, then the left interval ending subscript is `middle - 1`.


## Complexities:

- version 1: target in [left, right]
>Time Complexity: O(log n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)

- version 2: target in [left, right)
>Time Complexity: O(log n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)
