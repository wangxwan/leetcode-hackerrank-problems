## Problem Description

### Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.  
If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.  
You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.  


## Examples

>**Input**: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
>**Output**: [3,4]

>**Input**: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
>**Output**: [-1,-1]

>**Input**: nums = [], target = 0
>**Output**: [-1,-1]


## Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5^`
- `-10^9^ <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`
- `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
- `-10^9^ <= target <= 10^9^`


## Ideas:
From a beginner's perspective, I will break down this problem step by step and discuss all scenarios.  

Finding the left and right boundaries of the target in the array involves three situations:  

- Scenario 1: The target is to the right or left of the array range, for example, in the arrays {3, 4, 5}, if the target is 2 or in the array {3, 4, 5} and the target is 6, the output should be {-1, -1}.  
- Scenario 2: The target is within the array range but does not exist in the array, for example, in the array {3, 6, 7}, if the target is 5, the output should be {-1, -1}.  
- Scenario 3: The target is within the array range and exists in the array, for example, in the array {3, 6, 7}, if the target is 6, the output should be {1, 1}.  

After understanding these three scenarios, focus first on finding the right boundary, then shift focus to finding the left boundary, and make the final judgment based on both boundaries.

Utilizing the binary search method to find the left and right boundaries separately, I have written two binary search functions for clarity.


## Complexities:

>Space Complexity: O(1)
