## Problem Description

### Search Insert Position

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.  
You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.  


## Examples

>**Input**: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
>**Output**: 2

>**Input**: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
>**Output**: 1

>**Input**: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
>**Output**: 4


## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4^`
- `-10^4^ < nums[i] <= 10^4^`
- `nums` contains ***distinct*** values sorted in ***ascending*** order.
- `-10^4^ <= target <= 10^4^`

## Ideas:

In this problem, inserting a target value into an array can fall into one of these four scenarios:

- The target value is before all elements in the array
- The target value is equal to one of the elements in the array
- The target value is to be inserted into a specific position in the array
- The target value is after all elements in the array

Understanding these four scenarios clearly will enable us to attempt solving the problem.

## Complexities:

- version 1: brute force approach
>Time Complexity: O(n)
>Space Complexity: O(1)

- version 2: binary search method ---- target in [left, right]
>Time Complexity: O(log n)
>Space Complexity: O(1)

- version 3: binary search method ---- target in [left, right)
>Time Complexity: O(log n)
>Space Complexity: O(1)
