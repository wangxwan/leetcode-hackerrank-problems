## Problem Description

### Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return *the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.  
You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.  
- For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.


## Examples

>**Input**: x = 4
>**Output**: 2
>**Explanation**: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

>**Input**: x = 8
>**Output**: 2
>**Explanation**: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.


## Constraints:

- `0 <= x <= 2^31^ - 1`  


## Ideas:

Binary search.  

- if `x = 0` or `x = 1`: return x
>Then we can make `left = 1` and `right = x`, `return right` after the while loop.  
Compare with `x/middle`:
- if `middle > x/middle`: then middle^2^ > x, sqrt(x) is in the left half of the integer array from 1 to x.
- if `middle < x/middle`: then middle^2^ < x, sqrt(x) is in the right half of the integer array from 1 to x.
- if `middle = x/middle`: then middle^2^ = x, middle is sqrt(x).


## Complexities:

>Time Complexity: O(log n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)
