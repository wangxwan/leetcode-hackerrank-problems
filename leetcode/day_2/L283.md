## Problem Description

### Move Zeros

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.  
**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.  


## Examples

>**Input**: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]  
>**Output**: [1,3,12,0,0]  

>**Input**: nums = [0]  
>**Output**: [0]  


## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= $10^4$  
- $-2^31$ <= nums[i] <= $2^31$ - 1

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?


## Ideas:

*The elements of an array are stored in ==contiguous== memory addresses, so you can't just delete a single element from the array, you have to ==overwrite== it.*  
- Two-pointer method (fast-slow pointer method)
move all non zero numbers to left places  
>Use a fast pointer and a slow pointer to do the work of two loops in one loop.
>When nums[fastIndex] is a non zero number, it's time to swap nums[slowIndex] number and nums[fastIndex] number
>Define the fast and slow pointers:
>- Fast pointer: to search for the elements of the new array, which is the array without 0
>- Slow pointer: points to the position to update the index of the new array


## Complexities:

>Time Complexity: O(n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)
