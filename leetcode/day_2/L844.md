## Problem Description

### Backspace String Compare

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` *if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors*. `'#'` means a backspace character.  
Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.  


## Examples

>**Input**: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"  
>**Output**: true  
>**Explanation**: Both s and t become "ac".  

>**Input**: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"  
>**Output**: true  
>**Explanation**: Both s and t become "".  

>**Input**: s = "a#c", t = "b"  
>**Output**: false  
>**Explanation**: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".  


## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`  
- `s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `'#'` characters.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?


## Ideas:

*The elements of an array are stored in ==contiguous== memory addresses, so you can't just delete a single element from the array, you have to ==overwrite== it.*  
- Two-pointer method (fast-slow pointer method)  
>Use a fast pointer and a slow pointer to do the work of two loops in one loop.
>Define the fast and slow pointers:
>- Fast pointer: to search for the elements of the new array, which is the array without the target element
>- Slow pointer: points to the position to update the index of the new array


## Complexities:

>Time Complexity: O(n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)
