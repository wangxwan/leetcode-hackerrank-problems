## Problem Description

### Backspace String Compare

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` *if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors*. `'#'` means a backspace character.  
Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.  


## Examples

>**Input**: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"  
>**Output**: true  
>**Explanation**: Both s and t become "ac".  

>**Input**: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"  
>**Output**: true  
>**Explanation**: Both s and t become "".  

>**Input**: s = "a#c", t = "b"  
>**Output**: false  
>**Explanation**: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".  


## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`  
- `s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `'#'` characters.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?


## Ideas:

- Two pointers approach
1. Processing the string:  
>- If the character at the main pointer isn't `#`, it's "typed" at the location of the auxiliary pointer, which is then incremented.  
>- If the character is `#`, the preceding character is "erased" by decrementing the auxiliary pointer.  
>- The concluding value of the auxiliary pointer after processing gives the effective string length after considering backspaces.
2. Comparing the Strings:  
>After processing, the effective lengths (final values of `st1` and `st2`) are compared. A difference in lengths directly implies the strings aren't equal. If the lengths align, a character-by-character comparison is performed up to their effective lengths.  


## Complexities:

>Time Complexity: O(n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)
