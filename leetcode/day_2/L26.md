## Problem Description

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates ==in-place== such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return *the number of unique elements in `nums`*.  
Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:  
- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.  
- Return k.  


### Custom Judge: 

The judge will test your solution with the following code:  

    int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
    int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

    int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

    assert k == expectedNums.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
    }
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.


## Examples

>**Input**: nums = [1,1,2]  
>**Output**: 2, nums = [1,2,_]  
>**Explanation**: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).  

>**Input**: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]  
>**Output**: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]  
>**Explanation**: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).  


## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * $10^4$ 
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.


## Ideas:

*The elements of an array are stored in ==contiguous== memory addresses, so you can't just delete a single element from the array, you have to ==overwrite== it.*  
- version 1: brute force approach
>Two nested for loops, one for loop iterating through array elements, the second for loop updating the array.
- version 2: Two-pointer method (fast-slow pointer method)  
>Use a fast pointer and a slow pointer to do the work of two loops in one loop.
>Define the fast and slow pointers:
>- Fast pointer: to search for the elements of the new array, which is the array without the target element
>- Slow pointer: points to the position to update the index of the new array


## Complexities:

- version 1: brute force approach  
>Time Complexity: O($n^2$)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)

- version 2: Two-pointer method (fast-slow pointer method)  
>Time Complexity: O(n)  
>Space Complexity: O(1)
